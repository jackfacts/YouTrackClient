They are typically handed a piece of paper with the Pathologist's notes, enter in the information, print a report that the Pathologist reviews, and closes the case after the Pathologist okays the report.\n\nWe should essentially steal the Pathologist shell vm for starts.\nThey will need a search box for cases and a drop-down of Pathologists to select for whom they are entering the diagnosis.\nUpon selecting a case, they will need a list of slide diagnoses, followed by the case diagnoses.\nThey will need to be able to:\n - Save the case\n - Print, Save, etc. the Report (identical to what is currently at Pathologist)\n - As a secondary task (for us), they should be able to edit case demographics (e.g. add a mouse strain, if one was not entered at Accession)"
